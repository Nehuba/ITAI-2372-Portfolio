This module began with a general overview of types of AI, and some of their common uses.
The three main types covered were Artificial Narrow Intelligence, Artificial General Intelligence, and Generative AI.

Artificial Narrow Intelligence:
Created for a singular purpose, fed limited data for a limited output.

Artificial General Intelligence:
Theoretical, point where a machine can learn and apply knowledge on its own like a human does.

Generative Artificial Intelligence:
Generates new content based off pre-existing data.

Machine Learning: Takes inputs and outputs, learning and growing off taught data.
Use Example: Email Spam Detection (Input: Email) (Output: Spam) (Learns from the input and output to identify spam)

Further Use Examples, AI Evolution:
Maintenance
Manual: Reactive, repairs when machine goes down
Automatic: Proactive, scheduled maintenance for common failures
AI: Predictive Maintenance, predicts when individual faults may happen, prevents ahead of time
Generative AI: Generates new tasks to avoid common failures, and schedule based off future failures.

Example of AI Sabotage/Downsides:
Bad Data/Data Poisoning: Bad or misleading data can be implemented, poisoning an entire model even from small bits.
Bad Use of Data: Moral/Corrupt use of AI such as leaking private data, identifying faults, breaching security, etc.
