Credit Scoring/Risk Assessments:

- Can use personal information to identify risk assessments for loans, such as income, owed bills, and other financial situations.

Algorithm Trading:
- Predictive Algorithms can read recent, and current market trends to predict investments.
- Sentiment Analysis and situations that may increase/decrease stocks.
- Manipulative patterns can fake data, and lead to getting stocks increased/decreased.

Customer Service Automation:
- Financial Advice can be automated based on personal profiles/situations.
- Products/Plans can be recommended and sold easily to customers, even tailored to their needs to make them more appealing.
- Automatically schedule appointments and meetings with bankers.

Finance Forecasting:

- Can manage finances for specific resource allocation, and flow of where cash should and shouldn't go.


Problems of AI Use in Finance:
Bias:
- Most Common Data Abused is Geographic and Demographic
- Unfair Risk Assessments based on stereotypes/trends that may not apply to specific customers.
- Bad/Poisoned Financial Advice if any data is set on stereotypes, and general trends rather than personalized information.

Privacy: 
- Tracking Card Usage Data can be abused, companies basing their decisions on unnecessary payments or conditions.
- Detailed Records may provide information about habits or a customer's life they may not want to be known.

Transparency:
- Lack of Transparency increases risk of bad/biased decisions with unclear reasoning.

Data Breaches:
- Digitalized data is at risk, without safeguards AIs can be prompted to leak sensitive information
