This module focuses on the use cases, unsolved issues, and problems caused by AI in Entertainment and Media Industries

Major Use Cases:
Content Creation/Production:
- Generative AI can help write, critique, or create entire scripts for movies, games, or shows.
- Music Composition can be improved with AI tools that can tune, add instrumentals, vocals, or needed components.
- Video and Audio editing tools can be reduced to simple text prompts, that perform complex manipulation/generation.

Personalization/Recommendations:
- Streaming Services can base recommendations off what you watch, or listen to, as well as the engagement with content.
- News Aggregation can record interests, and offer relevant news based on recent conversations, or engagement.

Audience Engagement/Laying Traps:
- Interactive Advertisements can use chatbots to farm engagement, and harvest information from a user.

Game Development:
- AI can develop many parts of a game including story, chunks of code, and even make assets.
- Dynamic and Interactive environments/character interactions can be possible with generative AI
- Ad and suggestive placements can grab attention while playing games without being too direct or invasive.

Unsolved Problems:
Emotional Resonance: For creative pieces, less human interaction and involvement may be displeasing for both viewers and uninspiring for creators.
Originality/Authorship: AI is trained off an existing source, some which may be obtained without consent.
Bias/Repetitveness: AI is likely to generated the same or similar content, adding a familiar bias to all content.


Problems Created:
Copyright Violations: Not all content obtained/trained on is made with consent from original authors
Job Displacement: Easier to make content, less desired creative positions.
Deepfakes: Can be used for malicious scams, or violating privacy.
