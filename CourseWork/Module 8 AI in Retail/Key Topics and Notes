- Can manage inventory based on trends, seasons, geography, month, and predict the demand.
- Can automatically order, and increase/decrease amount of items needed.

- Can automatically detect issues/problems and provide appropriate responses.

Fraud Detection:
- Based on buying trends, can help prevent fraudlent charges in store and automatically contact owner for prevention.

Visual Search:
- Can find specific brands, and similar products just from an image of something someone is interested in.

Unsolved Issues:
Bias (Same as Previous Modules)
Privacy Concerns (Same as Previous Modules)
Integration Complexity/Cost (Same as Previous Modules)
Prediction Accuracy: Not all situations can be properly predicted, like outages or disasters.
Trust: Trends like adaptive pricing, and targeted advertisements can lead to distrust.


Problems Created by AI:
Over-Personalization: Recommendations based on recently spoken things that weren't publically displayed can cause distrust/concern.
Overreliance (Same as Previous Modules)
Ethical Concerns: How far AI delves into personal history, and how simple actions can lead to branded and targeted advertising leads to concern.
