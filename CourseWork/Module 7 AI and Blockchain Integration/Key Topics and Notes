This module focuses on the use cases of AI in Blockchain Technology

BlockChain: A decentralized, digital, and secure ledger able to store records/transactions between those with access.

Smart Contract Optimization:
- Smart contracts are important to optimize, AI can easily evaluate fairness and key points in a long contract.

Authoring Smart Contracts:
- AI can help easy creation of a secure and proper contract

Fraud Detection/Security:
- AI Systems can detect unusual activity, such as login locations and times to prevent fradulent activity.

Data Marketplace/Monetization:
- Marketplace Monitoring can verify customers, making sure they're trusted and secure.
- Malicious Buyers may block other buyers and de-value a price.
- Can also automatically set listings/proper prices based on the market.

Supply Chain Management:
- Able to automatically handle fulfilled contracts, product delivery, and payments.
- Can keep track of inventory, automatically order needed resources, and enforce contracts.

Identity Verficiation:
- Verify fake profiles, such as bot or scam accounts.

Predictive Analysis:
- Updated AI Systems can give good information on safe to buy crypto, and price increase/decreases.

Energy Effeciency:
- Mining crypto is expensive on GPU/CPUs, can automatically detect and schedule times they're not used as much for optimal mining.

Healthcare Records/Research:
- Patient confidentiality can be kept between hospitals, and detect patient transfers, care needed, and even sort the transfers on its own.

Decentralized AI Governance:
- No governing body over blockchains means transfers and data is secure.
- AI systems keeping track can make sure no illegal activity is being made, and link them to crimes without violating privacy.
