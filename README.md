A general portfolio of the work I did for my ITAI 2372 - Artificial Intel Applications course.
Includes modules going over different industries, and notes taken over the applications of AI in those industries.
Also includes Case Studies on individual industries, partially including my own solutions on some problems the industries face.

Each module has a Key Topics/Notes section, detailing some of the important points covered in the modules, and a brief overview of any case studies/projects finished in those modules.


This course offered me valuable insights on how various industries can implement AI, on both small scale individual levels and large-scale business levels. The course covered multiple industries like Healthcare, Agriculture, Finance, Entertainment, Retail, Manufacturing, and conceptual implementation like Smart Cities, Block Chain, and AGI. I have a broad understanding of AI that can help me create a solution, or implementation of AI for almost any business, industry, or project. Case Studies on specific industries, and abuse of AI have given me deep insight on proper utilization of AI, and what the dangers of improper AI implementation brings. I also now understand the future direction AI is headed, with even theoretical concepts like Artificial General Intelligence highlighting the benefits, and possibilities AI can bring.
